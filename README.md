# TPO IIT (BHU) Bot

A facebook messenger bot which gives real time updates of [Training and Placement portal](https://placement.iitbhu.ac.in/) of IIT (BHU) to the students. The bot periodically crawls the `company's visit` page and sends private text messages to registered users about new companies according to their branch and course.

The bot uses `Django` as backend framework for webhook, `Celery` as asynchronous task manager, `Redis` as message broker, `Wit` as intent parser, `sqlite3` as database for development on local machine and `postgres` for production on heroku, python's `requests` module for web crawling and `Ngrok` to setup a secure tunnel to localhost for development purposes.

The bot runs three jobs (1 Web server, 1 celery worker and 1 celery beat) on two dynos of heroku. ðŸ˜Ž
